Inflection Analysis Prototype Display

The files in this repository are a static instance of the output of the prototype [inflection analysis XQuery code](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/alpheios/code/utilities/text-services/inflections/trunk/). The initial goal behind that code was to demonstrate the type of functionality that could be made available dynamically working against a repository of fully annotated texts.  Ultimately XQuery is probably not be the right approach to this type of analysis, which could be done much more efficiently in any number of other ways. 

The display output is preserved here as a demonstration of the desired functionality.
